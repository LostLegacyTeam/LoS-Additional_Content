# Usage
You will need to use Sonic '06 Toolkit's ARC Studio, as a temporary solution until we have a tool to automate this process.

In ARC Studio, set the Source archive to the retail (unmodified) `sound.arc` and the Merge archive to the modified `sound.arc` you downloaded from here. Then set the Output to a memorable location and click Merge.

Your Output file will be the one used to play the mod. Create a backup of the archive you used as the Source file and replace it with the Output file.
